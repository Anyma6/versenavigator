   - **Credit the content creators**: If the original creator is not mentioned within the resource, please give proper credit in the description.
   - (_Optional_) **Include your RSI account link**: If you wish to receive recognition for your contribution, feel free to include a link to your RSI account alongside the resource.

4. **Submit a pull request** and clearly describe what you've added and why it's useful for the community. Ensure that all changes are limited to the `### ðŸ—‚ Categories` section. Changes outside this section are not allowed directly.

### Note on Modifications Outside of `Categories`
